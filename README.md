# GitHub Desktop Plus

This is a work in progress fork of [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) for Linux with additional features and improvements.

## Features and Roadmap

## General:

- [ ] Customizable **keyboard shortcuts**.
- [ ] Bitbucket integration:
  - [ ] Correctly set repository owner (instead of "Other").
  - [ ] Create pull requests.
  - [ ] View pull requests status, including checks.
- [ ] Jira integration:
  - [ ] Create and view Jira issues.
  - [ ] Create branches from Jira issues.

### Repositories list:

- [ ] **Pull all** button to fetch and pull from all remotes at once.
- [ ] Allow **collapsing groups** of repositories.

### Branches list:

- [ ] Add warning icon to **local-only branches** (branches that are not on the remote).
- [ ] Allow manually setting which is the **default branch** for a repository (base branch for creating new branches).

### History tab:

- [ ] **Search commits** by title or message.
- [ ] If a commit modifies only 1 file, allow double-clicking the commit to open the file.

### Changes tab:

- [ ] Context menu option to **permanently discard changes** without sending to trash (useful when the there are many changed files and the regular "Discard" is extremely slow).

## Running the app locally

### From the terminal

```bash
corepack enable           # Install yarn if needed
yarn                      # Install dependencies
yarn compile:dev:watch &  # Compile and watch for changes
yarn build:dev:watch &    # Build app and watch for changes
yarn start                # Start the app for development
```

- It's normal for the app to take a while to start up, especially the first time.

- While starting up, this error is normal: `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Invalid header: Does not start with Cr24`

### From VSCode

Instead of running:
```bash
yarn compile:dev:watch &
yarn build:dev:watch &
```

You can use the build shourtcut (by default, `Ctrl+Shift+B`), which will run both commands in the background.


## Why this fork?

While the "official" Linux fork of GitHub Desktop is great, I think it's slow in terms of updates and lacks some advanced features that I'd like. This fork has low code quality requirements compared to the official fork, so I (and hopefully you as well) can add features and improvements quickly.

This fork also focuses on integrating nicely with Atlassian products (Bitbucket, Jira, etc.), since I have to use them for work and haven't found a good desktop client for it.

# [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) - The Linux Fork

[![CI](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is an open-source [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based
GitHub app. It is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and
uses [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## What is this repository for?

This repository contains specific patches on top of the upstream
`desktop/desktop` repository to support Linux usage.

It also publishes [releases](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases) for various Linux distributions:

 - AppImage (`.AppImage`)
 - Debian (`.deb`)
 - RPM (`.rpm`)

## Installation via package manager

You can use your operating system's package manager to install `github-desktop` and
keep it up to date on Debian and RPM-based distributions.

### Debian/Ubuntu

There are two APT package feeds available, both hosted in the US. You only need
to add one or the other here, as both of these are generated based on the
releases from this repository.

#### [@shiftkey](https://github.com/shiftkey) package feed

```sh
wget -qO - https://apt.packages.shiftkey.dev/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/shiftkey-packages.gpg > /dev/null
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/shiftkey-packages.gpg] https://apt.packages.shiftkey.dev/ubuntu/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/shiftkey-packages.list'
```

#### [@mwt](https://github.com/mwt) package feed

```sh
wget -qO - https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/gpgkey | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/mwt-desktop.gpg > /dev/null
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mwt-desktop.gpg] https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/deb/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mwt-desktop.list'
```

#### Installation

Once you have a feed configured, run this command to install the application:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install github-desktop
```

### Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora

There are two RPM package feeds available, both hosted in the US. You only need
to add one or the other here, as both of these are generated based on the
releases from this repository.

#### [@shiftkey](https://github.com/shiftkey) package feed

```sh
sudo rpm --import https://rpm.packages.shiftkey.dev/gpg.key
sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[shiftkey-packages]\nname=GitHub Desktop\nbaseurl=https://rpm.packages.shiftkey.dev/rpm/\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://rpm.packages.shiftkey.dev/gpg.key" > /etc/yum.repos.d/shiftkey-packages.repo'
```

#### [@mwt](https://github.com/mwt) package feed

```sh
sudo rpm --import https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/gpgkey
sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[mwt-packages]\nname=GitHub Desktop\nbaseurl=https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/rpm\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/gpgkey" > /etc/yum.repos.d/mwt-packages.repo'
```

#### Installation

Once you have a feed configured, run this command to install the application:

```sh
# if yum is your package manager
sudo yum install github-desktop

# if dnf is your package manager
sudo dnf install github-desktop

# if zypper is your package manager
sudo zypper ref && sudo zypper in github-desktop
```

#### OpenSUSE

There are two RPM package feeds available, both hosted in the US. You only need
to add one or the other here, as both of these are generated based on the
releases from this repository.

#### [@shiftkey](https://github.com/shiftkey) package feed

```sh
sudo rpm --import https://rpm.packages.shiftkey.dev/gpg.key
sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[shiftkey-packages]\nname=GitHub Desktop\nbaseurl=https://rpm.packages.shiftkey.dev/rpm/\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://rpm.packages.shiftkey.dev/gpg.key" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/shiftkey-packages.repo'
```

#### [@mwt](https://github.com/mwt) package feed

```sh
sudo rpm --import https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/gpgkey
sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[mwt-packages]\nname=GitHub Desktop\nbaseurl=https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/rpm\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/gpgkey" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/mwt-packages.repo'

sudo zypper ref && sudo zypper in github-desktop
```


## Other Distributions

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can install GitHub Desktop from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/github-desktop-bin/).

`gnome-keyring` is required and the daemon must be launched either at login or when the X server is started. Normally this is handled by a display manager, but in other cases following the instructions found on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Keyring#Using_the_keyring_outside_GNOME) will fix the issue of not being able to save login credentials.

### Cross-Distribution Packages

GitHub Desktop is also available cross-platform as a [Flatpak](https://github.com/flathub/io.github.shiftey.Desktop) and [AppImage](https://appimage.github.io/GitHubDesktop/).

### deb-get

Debian/Ubuntu users can also install directly from this repository using [`deb-get`](https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get): `deb-get install github-desktop`.

## Known issues

If you're having troubles with Desktop, please refer to the [Known issues](docs/known-issues.md#linux)
document for guidance and workarounds for common limitations.

If your package manager is still trying to reach PackageCloud, refer to the
[cleanup instructions](docs/known-issues.md#the-packagecloud-package-feed-is-no-longer-working)
for details about migrating away.

## More information

Please check out the [README](https://github.com/desktop/desktop#github-desktop)
